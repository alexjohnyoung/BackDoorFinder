# BackDoorFinder
An addon designed to catch backdoors hidden in code

This was an addon created in 2015 for the game Garry's Mod.

At the time, there was a big issue that Steam Workshop addons would contain malicious code, and because the files were in .gma format 
you couldn't  manually inspect the code yourself.
